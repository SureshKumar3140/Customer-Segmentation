# Customer-Segmentation
This repository contains the code and results for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a marketing dataset. The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into customer demographics, behavior, and spending patterns to inform marketing strategies.

# Problem Statement
While going through the analysis, it is vital to have in mind an objective. We will attempt to answer the following questions through Visualization to see if we can find contributing factors to the success of the past campaigns.

Which products are performing best?
Which channels are underperforming?
What does the average customer look like for the Company?
Which marketing campaign is most successful?
Which Regions perform best?
Which costumer segment purchase more?
What does the costumer segment which accepted the last marketing campaign look like?

# Marketing Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the code and results for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a marketing dataset. The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into customer demographics, behavior, and spending patterns to inform marketing strategies.

## Project Overview

The dataset includes various attributes related to customers' demographics, enrollment dates, income, and spending habits on different product categories. This project involves the following steps:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
   - Importing the dataset.
   - Cleaning and preprocessing the data (handling missing values, converting data types, removing outliers).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualizing the distribution of key variables.
   - Understanding correlations between different attributes.
   - Identifying spending patterns and channel performance.
   - Analyzing customer demographics and their relationship with spending behavior.

3. Visualizations and Insights:
   - Generating and saving plots for data distribution, correlations, spending patterns, and more.
   - Summarizing key findings through visual and statistical representations.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Plotly:** For interactive plots and charts.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data analysis and documentation.
